## Restaurant Reviews GraphQL Server

---

An Implementation of the Restaurants Reviews PWA server using GraphGL

## Motivation

---

After learning how to use GraphQL in both backend and frontend use cases and building little projects following the [how to graphql](https://www.howtographql.com/) tutorial, I felt the implement what I have learnt both server-side and client-side for the knowledge to stick, then it all came together as I wanted full control of the latter restaurant reviews server implemented in Hapi js which i know nothing about to build my own server using Express and GraphQL.
